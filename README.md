[![test](https://github.com/fluxcd/multi-tenancy-team1/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fluxcd/multi-tenancy-team1/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml)

Demo repository for managing a multi-tenant cluster with Flux and Kustomize,
part of [fluxcd/multi-tenancy](https://github.com/fluxcd/multi-tenancy).

This repository uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kubernetes-toolset)
to validate the Kubernetes manifests with kubeval and a set of Open Policy Agent
[rego rules](https://github.com/fluxcd/multi-tenancy-team1/blob/master/.github/policy/).

GitHub [workflow](https://github.com/fluxcd/multi-tenancy-team1/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml):
* validate kustomize build with kubeval strict mode
* deny containers with latest image tag
* deny deployments and services without app label selector
* warn if deployments have no prometheus pod annotations
